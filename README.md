![Shoply design preview image](./public/design/preview.png)

## The Challenge‚ö°Ô∏è

I had the idea to build a fully functional eCommerce project using technologies that I liked. That's when I found this great course by [@SimpleTut](ttps://www.youtube.com/@SimpleTut) on Youtube. I immediately found interest in his teaching style and started this project.

I changed a couple of things from the course, such as using `typescript` instead of `javascript` and `scss` for styling.

This is a great repo if you want to get started with integrating `Redux Saga` with typescript and `React.js`.

Here was the challenge:

- Storing products, users, and orders in firebase cloud firestore.
- Using a strict & consistent folder architecture.
- Implementing a cart system using client-side logic.
- Handling CRUD operations with firebase, using Redux Saga.
- Creating a good harmony between React, Redux and Typescript.
